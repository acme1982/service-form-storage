### This website is to keep records of service forms for my bikes.

**Back end runs on express and mongoDB.**

Packages that I used:

- Redux
- redux-thunk (for async operations, middleware).
- lodash (for mapping through objects)
- react-redux, to connect to store.
- concurrently, to run servers in production.
- cors
